# Database Information

There are two databases in the ROAR ecosystem. The [Admin Database](/roar-docs/databases/admin) stores information regarding administrations, organizations, and identifiable information for all users. The [Assessment Database](/roar-docs/databases/assessment) stores information about each user's assignment responses organized into trial-level data and run-level data. This database also stores information about each task and its variants. User data in the two databases are linked to by a shared ROAR unique identifier (UID).
