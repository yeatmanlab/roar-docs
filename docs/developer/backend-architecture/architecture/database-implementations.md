# Database Implementations

The ROAR platform backend architecture is designed to support multiple database implementations. This is achieved through the use of a flexible and extensible data model that can be easily adapted to different database systems. The architecture also includes a set of standardized APIs that allow developers to interact with the data in a consistent and predictable way, regardless of the underlying database implementation.

Each backend implementation is instantiated using a factory pattern, which allows for easy creation and management of database connections. The factory pattern also provides a level of abstraction between the backend implementation and the rest of the application, making it easier to switch between different database systems without affecting the rest of the codebase.

## Firebase Implementation

The Firebase implementation uses Firebase Firestore and Google Cloud Functions for serverless backend services. This implementation is created using the `createFirestoreImplementation()` factory function from the `@roar-firebase-functions/core` package.

### Implementation Structure

The Firestore implementation contains the following components:

- **Repository Classes**: Specialized data access classes for different entity types:

  - `FirestoreAdministrationRepository`
  - `FirestoreIdentityProviderRepository`
  - `FirestoreOrgRepository`
  - `FirestoreUserRepository`
  - `FirestoreUserClaimRepository`
  - `FirestoreBaseRepository` (base class with common functionality)

- **Service Classes**: Business logic layers that use repositories:

  - `AdministrationService`
  - `IdentityProviderService`

- **Filter Adapters**: Tools for converting abstract filter conditions to Firestore-specific queries:
  - `FirestoreFilterAdapter`

### Usage

To use the Firestore implementation, import the factory function and call it:

```typescript
import { createFirestoreImplementation } from "@roar-firebase-functions/core";

const firestoreImpl = createFirestoreImplementation();
```

This returns a `FirestoreImplementation` object containing all initialized repositories and services, ready to use with standardized APIs for data access and manipulation.

### Benefits

- **Serverless Architecture**: No need to manage server infrastructure
- **Real-time Data**: Built-in support for real-time updates
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales with usage
- **Security**: Integrated with Firebase Authentication and security rules
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with other Google Cloud services
