# Backend Architecture in ROAR

ROAR implements a Repository Pattern Architecture (also known as Clean Architecture) to establish a clear separation of concerns and maintain scalable data operations.

## Core Principles

### Dependency Injection
The architecture leverages dependency injection to achieve loose coupling between components. Dependencies are supplied through interfaces, enabling:
- Easier unit testing through dependency mocking
- Flexible component replacement without affecting the broader application
- Clear contract definitions between components

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Following DIP, high-level modules don't depend on low-level modules - both depend on abstractions. This is implemented through interfaces that define component contracts, with concrete classes providing the actual implementations.

## Architectural Layers

### 1. Domain (Model) Layer
Defines the core business entities and their behaviors through interfaces. These models establish contracts for data operations throughout the application.

Core Domain Models:
- Administration
- Assignment
- Class
- District
- Family
- Identity Provider
- Group
- Legal
- Run
- School
- Score
- Task
- Trial
- User Claim
- User
- Variant

### 2. Repository Layer
Acts as a data access abstraction layer that:
- Encapsulates data access logic
- Provides a consistent interface regardless of data source
- Maintains single responsibility per entity
- Defines explicit contracts between frontend and backend
- Handles CRUD operations for specific entities

### 3. Service Layer
Implements business logic by:
- Orchestrating operations across repositories
- Processing domain entities
- Remaining data source agnostic
- Enforcing business rules and workflows
- Coordinating complex operations across multiple repositories

### 4. Controller Layer
Manages HTTP communication by:
- Handling incoming API requests
- Validating request data
- Coordinating with appropriate services
- Formatting API responses
- Maintaining REST best practices

## Benefits
This architecture provides:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved testability
- Flexible data source switching
- Scalable and maintainable codebase
- Consistent data access patterns
