# syncAssignmentUpdated()

#### [syncAssignmentUpdated](https://github.com/yeatmanlab/roar-firebase-functions/blob/e784650492722d24069aa9b0704d1873ea5dafee/gse-roar-admin/functions/src/index.ts#L640)

### Function Name
`syncAssignmentUpdated`

### Trigger
This Cloud Function is triggered by an update event on any document within the path `users/{roarUid}/assignments/{assignmentUid}`. It listens for changes to assignment documents and executes data synchronization based on those changes.

### Operation
The function performs the following operations:

1. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Extracts previous (`prevData`) and current (`currData`) data from the assignment document to determine changes.
   - Retrieves document paths and organizational data from the assignment.

2. **Database Transactions**:
   - **Document Reference Setup**: Establishes references to necessary documents within Firestore, including user documents and assignment statistics documents in the `administrations` collection.
   - **Statistics Update**: Analyzes changes between previous and current data to adjust counters in organizational and assignment-level statistics.
   - **Status Updates**: Updates the user's document to reflect changes in the assignment's status (e.g., started, completed) based on the data comparison.

### Detailed Workflow

- **Initial Checks**:
  - Verifies that the document snapshot is valid and contains data to process.

- **Transaction Execution**:
  - **Organizational Changes**: Identifies added or removed organizations and adjusts assignment counters accordingly. This includes handling counters for assigned, started, and completed statuses.
  - **Task Status Changes**: Checks each task within the assignment for changes in status (e.g., from not started to started or from started to completed) and updates counters and user document fields accordingly.

### Error Handling and Security Considerations

- **Error Handling**:
  - Manages errors during database transactions, ensuring that any issues are caught and handled appropriately. Logs errors and attempts retries up to a specified limit.
  - Provides robust handling of incomplete data or unexpected document structures to prevent erroneous data manipulation.

- **Security**:
  - Ensures that only authorized changes trigger the function, using Firestore security rules to restrict access based on user roles or document ownership.
  - Validates changes to sensitive data fields to ensure integrity and prevent unauthorized data modification.

### Deployment and Maintenance

This function is deployed automatically using GitHub actions, whenever changes are merged into the `main` branch.
