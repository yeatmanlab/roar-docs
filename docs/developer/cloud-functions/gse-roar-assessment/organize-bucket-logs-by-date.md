# organizeBucketLogsByDate()

### Function Name
`organizeLogsByDate`

### Description
This Cloud Function automates the process of organizing log files stored in a cloud bucket. It triggers on the event of a file creation or update and moves the file into a directory structure organized by the date of the operation.

### Trigger
The function is typically triggered by a file creation or update event in a cloud storage bucket. The exact trigger setup may depend on the cloud provider's specific mechanisms for monitoring storage events.

### Operation
The function performs the following steps:

1. **File Path Analysis**:
   - Extracts the file path from the event data, which includes the full path where the file is stored.
   - Checks if the file is located within a designated logs subdirectory. If not, the function logs an informational message and exits without further action.

2. **Date Extraction**:
   - Retrieves the current date and formats it into year, month, and day components. This helps in constructing the target directory path based on the date the function is executed.

3. **File Relocation**:
   - Constructs a new file path that includes the date components.
   - Moves the file from its original location to the new date-based directory within the same bucket.

### Parameters
- **event**: Contains information about the storage event, including the file path.
- **context**: Provides additional context about the event, such as the event trigger time and other metadata.

### Workflow Example
- A log file named `error.log` is uploaded to a bucket in the path `system-logs/error.log`.
- The function is triggered and identifies the file path.
- It constructs a new path based on the current date, such as `system-logs/2023/04/15/error.log`.
- The file is moved to the new path within the same bucket.

### Error Handling
- The function includes checks to ensure the file resides within the expected log directory structure. If it does not, it logs an error and halts further execution to prevent misplacement of non-log files.
- Errors during the file move operation (such as permissions issues or network errors) should be caught and logged appropriately.

### Security Considerations
- **Permissions**: Ensure the function has appropriate permissions to read from and write to the storage bucket.
- **Validation**: Confirm that the paths and file names are correctly formatted and sanitized to avoid path traversal vulnerabilities.

### Deployment and Maintenance
This function is deployed automatically using GitHub actions, whenever changes are merged into the `main` branch.
