# Data Requests and Task Management

If you have any questions regarding ROAR data please review the documentation on this website. If you still have questions, please submit an issue on the [Data Request Form](https://github.com/yeatmanlab/roar-bigquery/issues). 

If you need help on a task regarding ROAR data, create a task on Kelly's [Data Task Management Project Board](https://github.com/users/kellywentz/projects/1). 

## Why a Data Request Form? 
The Data Request Form is a great way for researchers to review previous questions proposed by members within the lab regarding ROAR data--think of it like a Stack Overflow or Reddit thread. 

The Data Request Form helps data scientists and data engineers make informed decisions about data formats and pipelines in the future. 

The Data Request Form helps data scientists organize requests/questions coming in. 

The Data Request Form helps create a flow for documentation and ensures users have read documentation prior to asking for help. 

## Why a Data Task Management Project Board 
The task management system helps researchers see where their tasks are in order of priority. 

The task management system allows researchers to see where the ROAR Data Scientist is at in the process of completing the task (To Do, In Progress, Done, Blocked).

The task management system helps outlines the timelines of numerous projects that the ROAR Data Scientist is working on for their own sake as well as for the team's sake. 

## What can I ask in the Data Request Form and on the Data Task Management Project Board? 
Users can ask any questions regarding: 
- Statistical/Mathematical theory 
    - Understanding models, figures, etc.
- R/SQL/Python review 
    - Overall code review 
- ROAR database questions 
    - Understanding runs, trials, variables, where does the data exist etc. 
- GitHub functionality and workflow 
    - Understanding the process, downloading GitHub, etc. 
- Demographics data 
    - Where the data is located, cleaning them, understanding clever vs. CSV, etc. 
- BigQuery data pulls 
    - SQL code review, tips, function explanations
