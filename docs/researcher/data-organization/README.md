# Data Organization 

## ROAR Assessment Data
1. Store outputted csv’s on your own system (you can delete after you have compiled if they take up too much storage) 
2. Do not store individual outputted csv’s from BigQuery on Lab Google Drives (it will become too messy) 
3. If you are working on an existing project, store the data in the corresponding folder in the ROAR Research Data Drive 
4. If you are starting a new project, create a new folder in the ROAR Research Data Drive 
5. **DO NOT make any new folders on the ROAR Primary Research Data Drive!**

## ROAR Demographics Data
There are many places where demographics data exists and is safely stored.
1. **ROAR-SchoolDistrict-Data** is a secure Stanford Google Shared Drive. The data that is put in this could include any demographics data provided by a school. Carrie Townley-Flores and Kelly Wentzlof downloaded all student demographics for the 23-24 school year from the CSV schools and the Clever schools and placed the demographcis in this folder. These downloaded csv's where used in the majority of the technical manual. Additionally, this drive contains school assessment data that does not include ROAR data. The assessment data could be state standardized tests or other measures the school took the same year or previous years that they took ROAR including iReady, MCAS, ELPAC, etc. 
2. **ROAR - CSV Upload** is a secure Stanford Google Shared Drive. The data that is put in this includes all CSV Upload schools and their students' accounts. Some schools provide demographics and the number of demographics per school varies. While we ask for race, ethnicity, gender, home language, free/reduced lunch status, english language learner status, special education status--only a few schools give all the demographics of all the students that take ROAR. 
3. **ROAR - Primary Demographics Data** is a secure Stanford Google Shared Drive. The data that is put in this is pulled from BigQuery. The data likely overlaps with the data in the other google drives, but *it does not hold longitudinal data*.
