# Data Tools
The purpose of this page is to get researchers familiar with various tools often used in the lab. If you have any questions regarding any of these tools, please refer to the [Data Requests Page](https://yeatmanlab.github.io/roar-docs/researcher/data-requests/). 

## GitHub 
This section will get researchers acquainted with using GitHub for research projects, IRB modifications, documentation updates, etc. 

### [GitHub Lingo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/github-glossary) 
- Repository: A project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
- Clone: To copy the files of a repository to the user's local device. 
- Main: The "live" branch that should never directly be edited (unless approved by ROAR leads or Kelly Wentzlof, data scientist). The default development branch. Whenever you create a Git repository, a branch named main is created, and becomes the active branch. 
- Branch: A parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes. 
- Commit: A "revision"--an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when. 
- Push: To send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com where others can see them. 
- Fetch: When you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them. 
- Pull: When you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.
- Merge:  Takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.
- Pull Request: Proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Linked to a specific branch and the changes pushed to that branch. 
- Issue: Suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository.
- Markdown (.md, .Rmd): An incredibly simple semantic file format, not too dissimilar from .doc, .rtf and .txt. Markdown makes it easy for even those without a web-publishing background to write prose (including with links, lists, bullets, etc.) and have it displayed like a website.
- README: A text file containing information about the files in a repository that is typically the first file a visitor to your repository will see. 

### Downloading GitHub
Follow the instructions to [download GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop). 

### Yeatman Lab GitHub 
Please tag Adam Richie-Halford in a slack message in #roar-pii-maintanence-requests requesting access to the Yeatman Lab GitHub. This will grant you access to all public and private repositories 

### Navigating the GitHub website 
On the Yeatman Lab homepage, users will see >100 different repositories. Each repository should have a README.md file which will explain what the repository stores and the researchers'/developers' goals. The user should find the repository that they would like to read/contribute to via the search bar or scrolling. 

### Cloning a repository 
Once the user finds the repository that they would like to contribute to, they will click the repository and be taken to the home page of the repository. To contribute to the files within the repository, the user will need to "clone" the repository to their local device.
