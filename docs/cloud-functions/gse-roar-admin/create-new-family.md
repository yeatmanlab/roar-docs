#### [createnewfamily](https://github.com/yeatmanlab/roar-firebase-functions/blob/e784650492722d24069aa9b0704d1873ea5dafee/gse-roar-admin/functions/src/index.ts#L171)

### Function Name
`createnewfamily`

### Trigger
This Cloud Function is triggered by an `onCall` event, meaning it is invoked directly by client applications through a specific API call.

### Inputs
The function accepts a JSON payload with several parameters necessary to create a new family account:
- **caretakerEmail** (string): The email address of the caretaker, which will be used as a primary identifier and for communications.
- **caretakerPassword** (string): The password for the caretaker's account. It is crucial that this data is handled securely through the function.
- **caretakerUserData** (object): A set of additional user data related to the caretaker, such as name, contact info, and any relevant preferences or settings.
- **children** (array): A list of objects, each containing data about a child within the family. This could include names, ages, and other specific information relevant to the application.
- **isTestData** (boolean, optional): A flag indicating whether this account is being created for testing purposes. Defaults to `false` if not provided.

Example JSON input:
```json
{
  "caretakerEmail": "caretaker@example.com",
  "caretakerPassword": "securepassword123",
  "caretakerUserData": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "contactInfo": "1234567890"
  },
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "age": 7
    },
    {
      "name": "Doe Junior",
      "age": 5
    }
  ],
  "isTestData": false
}
```

### Outputs
The function returns the result from the `createFamily` operation, which typically would be:
- A success message or object indicating that the family account has been successfully created.
- An error message or object if the operation fails, detailing the reason for the failure such as invalid input data, database errors, or authentication issues.

### Description
The `createnewfamily` function is responsible for setting up new family profiles in the system. It orchestrates the creation of user accounts for a caretaker and registers associated children under this new family entity. This function ensures that all necessary data is collected, validated, and securely stored in the systemâ€™s database.

It also creates `subGroups` for each family to associate the families children with other ROAR organizations. These orgs are identified as "parent" orgs (not to be confused with the caretaker). For example, a child might be associated with the new family and also the default "ROAR families" group. This child would then also be added to a new group, whose `familyId` is set to this new family and whose `parentOrgType` is "group" and `parentOrgId` is that of the default "ROAR families" group.

### Error Handling
The function should include robust error handling to address potential issues such as:
- Invalid email formats or password strength.
- Database write failures or connectivity issues.
- Handling missing or incomplete data in the `caretakerUserData` or `children` fields.
- Security concerns related to data handling and password management.

Errors should be logged to a secure logging service, providing sufficient detail for debugging while ensuring user data privacy.

### Security Considerations
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Ensure that the function can only be accessed by authenticated users who have permission to create new family profiles.
- **Data Validation**: Thoroughly validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Use secure practices for handling passwords and personal information, possibly involving hashing passwords before storage and ensuring secure transmission of sensitive data.

### Deployment
This function is deployed automatically using GitHub actions, whenever changes are merged into the `main` branch.
