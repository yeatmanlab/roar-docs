### Function Name
`syncCleverUser`

#### 1. **syncCleverUser**
This callable Cloud Function acts as an entry point for client applications to initiate the synchronization process of user data from Clever.

##### Trigger
- **Type**: Callable function.
- **Authentication**: Requires users to be authenticated; accesses the user's UID through `request.auth.uid`.

##### Parameters
- **request**: Contains the necessary credentials and identifiers to fetch and synchronize user data:
  - `assessmentUid`: UID used within the assessment Firebase project.
  - `accessToken`: Access token for authenticating requests to the Clever API.

##### Operation
- Extracts the authenticated user's UID and other necessary parameters from the request.
- Calls the `getCleverUser` function to perform the actual data synchronization process.

#### 2. **getCleverUser**
A backend utility function that handles the actual interaction with the Clever API, retrieves user data, and updates Firebase Authentication and Firestore accordingly.

##### Parameters
- **roarUid**: ROAR-specific user identifier.
- **adminUid**: Administrator UID in the Firebase admin project.
- **assessmentUid**: UID used within the assessment Firebase project.
- **accessToken**: Token used to authenticate requests to the Clever API.

##### Operation
- Configures API requests and fetches user data from Clever.
- Processes the retrieved data to update Firebase Authentication custom claims and Firestore documents across both admin and assessment projects.

### Detailed Workflow

1. **Authentication and API Setup**:
   - Configures Axios for API requests to Clever using the provided `accessToken`.
   - Establishes Firebase and Firestore instances for necessary database interactions.

2. **Data Retrieval from Clever**:
   - Fetches user data from Clever using the `/me` endpoint and follows links to specific user resources.
   - Extracts and logs user data for further processing.

3. **Firebase Data Processing**:
   - Runs transactions to ensure atomic updates across Firebase services.
   - Updates custom claims and Firestore documents to reflect the latest user data from Clever.
   - Conditionally handles data based on whether the operation pertains to the admin or assessment database.

4. **Role-Specific Data Handling**:
   - Processes user roles from Clever to update Firebase data accordingly, utilizing role mappings and custom logic to handle administrative and educational data specifically.
   - Uses transactions to update Firestore documents, ensuring data consistency and reliability.

### Error Handling and Security Considerations

- **Error Handling**:
  - Implements comprehensive error handling throughout the API interaction and data processing stages.
  - Catches and logs errors related to API failures, Firebase operations, and data integrity issues.

- **Security**:
  - Ensures all operations are performed under strict authentication checks to prevent unauthorized access.
  - Validates and sanitizes incoming data from Clever to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

### Deployment and Maintenance

- **Deployment**: Deploy these functions using Firebase CLI tools or through the Firebase Console, ensuring they are configured with the necessary permissions to interact with Firebase Authentication and Firestore.

- **Maintenance**: Regularly monitor these functions for performance issues and errors. Update the logic as necessary, especially in response to changes in the Clever API or Firebase platform updates.
