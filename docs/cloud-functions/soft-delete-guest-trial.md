### Function Name
`softDeleteGuestTrial`

#### 1. **createSoftDeleteCloudFunction**
This utility function dynamically generates Cloud Functions designed to handle the soft deletion of documents by moving them to corresponding "deleted" collections when they are deleted from their primary collection. It provides a framework for creating functions that manage data retention effectively across various collection structures.

##### Operation
- **Trigger Configuration**: Uses the `constructTrigger` function to create a Firestore trigger based on specified collections.
- **Soft Deletion Mechanism**: On document deletion, the generated function moves the document to a new path within a "deleted" collection, preserving its data.

#### 2. **softDeleteGuestTrial**
A specific Cloud Function generated by `createSoftDeleteCloudFunction`, tailored to handle deletions within the nested `guests`, `runs`, and `trials` collections. This function ensures that even deeply nested documents are preserved after deletion.

### Detailed Workflow and Implementation

- **Trigger Construction** (`constructTrigger`):
  - Configures a Firestore document path that listens for deletion events across specified collections. For `softDeleteGuestTrial`, it constructs a path like `guests/{doc0}/runs/{doc1}/trials/{doc2}`.
  - Dynamically creates path variables (`doc0`, `doc1`, `doc2`) corresponding to each collection level.

- **Document References Creation** (`createDocRefs`):
  - Generates Firestore document references for both the source and target locations based on the structured document path created by the trigger.
  - Maps documents from their original location in active collections to new locations in corresponding "deleted" collections.

- **Soft Deletion Handling**:
  - Upon detecting a document's deletion, retrieves the document's data from the source reference.
  - Moves the document data to the target path within the "deleted" collection, ensuring data retention and archival.

### Error Handling and Security Considerations

- **Error Handling**:
  - Implements error handling during the document transfer process to manage and log failures, ensuring robust operation.
  - Handles cases where document data might be null or missing, preventing failures and ensuring the function exits gracefully under such conditions.

- **Security**:
  - Enforces security rules to ensure that only authorized deletions trigger the soft deletion process, protecting against unauthorized data manipulation.
  - Validates document paths and ensures that document operations conform to predefined security policies.

### Deployment and Maintenance

- **Deployment**: These functions should be deployed using Firebase CLI tools or through the Firebase Console. Proper trigger configurations and memory allocations must be set to handle the expected document structure and operational load.
  
- **Maintenance**: Regular monitoring of these functions is essential to ensure they perform as expected. Logs should be reviewed to detect any operational issues, and the function logic may need updates to adapt to changes in data structures or organizational requirements.
