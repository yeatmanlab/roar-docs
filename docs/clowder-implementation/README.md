# Clowder Integration

## Overview
This series of documents outline the changes made to integrate Clowder into a project. Clowder is a framework that manages multiple CAT (Computerized Adaptive Testing) instances, allowing flexible item selection based on various stopping rules and corpus configurations.

## Impact
- **More flexible and adaptive item selection** through Clowder's CAT management.
- **Improved modularity** by centralizing CAT logic in Clowder.
- **Better scalability** for managing multiple adaptive testing categories.
