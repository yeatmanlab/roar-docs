# Firebase Emulation

Firebase Emulation is a feature of the Firebase CLI that allows you to run a local server that emulates the Firebase services you are using in your project. This is useful for testing your app locally without having to deploy it to Firebase.
ROAR utilizes Firebase Emulation to test the Firebase services that are used in the project. This allows the developer to test the app locally and inspect the data that is being sent to the Firebase services.

## Getting Started
The documentation for Firebase Emulation can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite). The Firebase Emulator Suite is a set of local tools that allow you to test your app against the Firebase services locally. The Firebase Emulator Suite includes the following emulators:
- Firestore
- Realtime Database
- Firebase Authentication
- Firebase Hosting
- Firebase Functions
- Firebase Pub/Sub
- Firebase Storage
- Firebase Extensions
