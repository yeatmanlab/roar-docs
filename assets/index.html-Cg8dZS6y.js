A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file&#39;s revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.</li><li>Clone: To copy the files of a repository to the user&#39;s local device.</li><li>Main: The &quot;live&quot; branch that should never directly be edited (unless approved by ROAR leads or Kelly Wentzlof, data scientist). The default development branch. Whenever you create a Git repository, a branch named main is created, and becomes the active branch.</li><li>Branch: A parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the &quot;live&quot; version. When you&#39;ve made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.</li><li>Commit: A &quot;revision&quot;--an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when.</li><li>Push: To send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com where others can see them.</li><li>Fetch: When you&#39;re adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them.</li><li>Pull: When you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you&#39;re both working on, you&#39;ll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it&#39;s up to date.</li><li>Merge: Takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.</li><li>Pull Request: Proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository&#39;s collaborators. Linked to a specific branch and the changes pushed to that branch.</li><li>Issue: Suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository.</li><li>Markdown (.md, .Rmd): An incredibly simple semantic file format, not too dissimilar from .doc, .rtf and .txt. Markdown makes it easy for even those without a web-publishing background to write prose (including with links, lists, bullets, etc.) and have it displayed like a website.</li><li>README: A text file containing information about the files in a repository that is typically the first file a visitor to your repository will see.</li></ul><h3 id="downloading-github" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#downloading-github"><span>Downloading GitHub</span></a></h3><p>Follow the instructions to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download GitHub Desktop</a>.</p><h3 id="yeatman-lab-github" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#yeatman-lab-github"><span>Yeatman Lab GitHub</span></a></h3><p>Please tag Adam Richie-Halford in a slack message in #roar-pii-maintanence-requests requesting access to the Yeatman Lab GitHub.
