This is useful for testing your app locally without having to deploy it to Firebase. ROAR utilizes Firebase Emulation to test the Firebase services that are used in the project. This allows the developer to test the app locally and inspect the data that is being sent to the Firebase services.</p><h2 id="getting-started" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#getting-started"><span>Getting Started</span></a></h2><p>The documentation for Firebase Emulation can be found <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
