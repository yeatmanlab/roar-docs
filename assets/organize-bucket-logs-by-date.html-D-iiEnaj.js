It triggers on the event of a file creation or update and moves the file into a directory structure organized by the date of the operation.</p><h3 id="trigger" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#trigger"><span>Trigger</span></a></h3><p>The function is typically triggered by a file creation or update event in a cloud storage bucket. The exact trigger setup may depend on the cloud provider&#39;s specific mechanisms for monitoring storage events.</p><h3 id="operation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#operation"><span>Operation</span></a></h3><p>The function performs the following steps:</p><ol><li><p><strong>File Path Analysis</strong>:</p><ul><li>Extracts the file path from the event data, which includes the full path where the file is stored.</li><li>Checks if the file is located within a designated logs subdirectory. If not, the function logs an informational message and exits without further action.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Date Extraction</strong>:</p><ul><li>Retrieves the current date and formats it into year, month, and day components. This helps in constructing the target directory path based on the date the function is executed.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>File Relocation</strong>:</p><ul><li>Constructs a new file path that includes the date components.</li><li>Moves the file from its original location to the new date-based directory within the same bucket.</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id="parameters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#parameters"><span>Parameters</span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>event</strong>: Contains information about the storage event, including the file path.</li><li><strong>context</strong>: Provides additional context about the event, such as the event trigger time and other metadata.</li></ul><h3 id="workflow-example" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#workflow-example"><span>Workflow Example</span></a></h3><ul><li>A log file named <code>error.log</code> is uploaded to a bucket in the path <code>system-logs/error.log</code>.</li><li>The function is triggered and identifies the file path.</li><li>It constructs a new path based on the current date, such as <code>system-logs/2023/04/15/error.log</code>.</li><li>The file is moved to the new path within the same bucket.</li></ul><h3 id="error-handling" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#error-handling"><span>Error Handling</span></a></h3><ul><li>The function includes checks to ensure the file resides within the expected log directory structure.
